A search for charged-lepton flavor violation has been performed in the top quark sector through both top quark production and decay signal processes. The data were collected by the CMS experiment from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The selected events are required to contain one opposite-sign electron-muon pair, a third charged lepton (electron or muon), at least one jet, and at most one jet associated with a bottom quark. The analysis utilizes boosted decision trees to separate background processes from a possible signal, exploiting differences in the kinematics of the final state particles. The data are found to be consistent with the standard model expectation. Upper limits at 95\% confidence level are placed on the branching fractions involving up (charm) quarks, t$\rightarrow\textsf{e}\mu$u (t$\rightarrow\textsf{e}\mu$c), of $0.032 \times 10^{-6}$ ($0.498 \times 10^{-6}$), $0.022 \times 10^{-6}$ ($0.369 \times 10^{-6}$), and $0.012 \times 10^{-6}$ ($0.216 \times 10^{-6}$) for tensor, vector, and scalar interactions, respectively.
