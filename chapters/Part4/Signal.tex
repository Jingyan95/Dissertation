 \caption{Representative Feynman diagrams for the signal processes that are targeted by this analysis. Both top quark decay (left) and production (middle and right) \ac{CLFV} processes are shown. The indices $i$,  $j$, and $k$ are lepton flavor indices that run from 1 to 3 with the following conditions: i) $i\neq j$, ii) one of these three indices is 3, and iii) the other two are smaller than 3.}
