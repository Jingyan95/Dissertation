\part{Outlook for CLFV Searches Using Top Quarks}
\label{Part4}
The \autoref{Part4} of this thesis describes an ongoing physics analysis that is an extension of the analysis documented in \autoref{Part3}. Under the supervision of Prof. Louise Skinnari, Emily Minyun Tsai and I started working on this analysis in January 2023. Materials presented in the \autoref{Part4} have not yet been fully approved by the \ac{CMS} Collaboration and shall not be considered finalized. The \autoref{Part4} is organized as follows. \autoref{chap:Signal} gives a description of the signal processes targeted by this analysis and how they are generated. Object- and event-level selection criteria used by this analysis are described in \autoref{chap:Obj} and \autoref{chap:Evt}, respectively. \autoref{chap:Sensitivity} presents results of a preliminary sensitivity study.
