This thesis presents results from a search for charged-lepton flavor violation in both top quark production and decay processes. The data used were collected by the \ac{CMS} experiment during 2016--2018 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. Events were selected for analysis if they contain exactly three charged leptons---one electron and one muon of opposite electric charge as well as one additional electron or muon. Events must also contain at least one jet of which no more than one is associated with a bottom quark. An effective field theory approach is used for parametrizing the charged-lepton flavor violating interactions. Boosted decision trees are used to distinguish a possible signal from the background. No significant excess is observed over the prediction from the standard model. Upper limits at the 95\% confidence level are set on the branching fractions involving up (charm) quarks, $\tto{u}$ ($\tto{c}$), of $0.032 (0.498) \times 10^{-6}$, $0.022 (0.369) \times 10^{-6}$, and $0.012 (0.216) \times 10^{-6}$ for tensor, vector, and scalar interactions, respectively. These limits constitute the most stringent ones to date on these processes, improving the existing limits by roughly one order of magnitude.
