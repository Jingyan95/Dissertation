The \ac{SM} of particle physics 



This thesis describes the research work I did in 2019-2023 on the \ac{CMS} experiment, including a brief description of the surrounding context and background knowledge. This thesis is organized into four parts, and the \autoref{Part1} introduces the theoretical foundation of high energy particle physics, including the electroweak theory, \ac{QCD}, and theories \ac{BSM}. Descriptions of the \ac{LHC} and {CMS} experiment, including the operational and upgrade work that I made direct contributions to, are given in the \autoref{Part2}. The \autoref{Part3} describes a search for $\emut{q}$ interactions using data collected by the \ac{CMS} detector in 2016-2018. The scope of this search is expanded to include $\textsf{e}\uptau\textsf{qt}$ and $\upmu\uptau\textsf{qt}$ interactions in a second search, which is described in the \autoref{Part4}.
