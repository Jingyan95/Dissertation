\section{Profile Likelihood Fit}
\label{sec:PLF}

A binned likelihood function $\mathcal{L}(\mu, \theta)$ is constructed to perform the statistical analysis on the BDT discriminator distributions. The parameter of interest (POI), denoted by $\mu$, is the signal strength that governs the cross section of the ST and TT signals simultaneously. All the uncertainties are incorporated into the likelihood function as nuisance parameters, denoted by $\theta$. The uncertainties that affect the shape of the BDT discriminator distributions are considered with Gaussian distributions while other uncertainties that only affect the normalizations are considered with log-normal distributions. 

To control the systematic uncertainties, a profile likelihood fit is performed simultaneously in six regions (three data-taking years and two signal regions) by maximizing the likelihood function $\mathcal{L}(\hat{\mu}, \hat{\theta})$. Both $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\theta}$ are the maximum likelihood estimators for the signal strength and nuisance parameters, respectively. The scaling of the signal for the purpose of a better visualization is optimized based on ``VecU" signal, and it is kept the same for the other signals to compare their cross sections relative to each other. The post-fit distributions of the BDT discriminator are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bdt_postfit_VecU}-\ref{fig:bdt_postfit_ScalarC}. The most prominent uncertainties affecting the likelihood fit are the statistical uncertainties on MC samples.

\section{Upper Limits}
\label{sec:Limits}

The results for the one-dimensional limits are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:limit}. Assuming a linear relationship between $\mathcal{B}(\tto{c})$ and $\mathcal{B}(\tto{c})$ in the case of nonvanishing signals, the two-dimensional limits can also be obtained through interpolation (see Fig.~\ref{fig:2dlimit}). This analysis constitutes the most stringent limits on these processes to date.
