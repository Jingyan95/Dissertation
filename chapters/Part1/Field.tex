\chapter{Field Content of the Standard Model}
\label{chap:Field}

The \ac{SM} of particle physics is a quantum field theory that combines the concept of classic field theory with quantum mechanics and special relativity. Different elementary particles can be described as the excited states of distinct quantum fields, characterized by masses and various quantum numbers. A summary of the known elementary particles and their properties is given in Figure~\ref{fig:Field}.

The effects described by special relativity apply to all elementary particles. This requires the the theory to be invariant under Lorentz transformations, which contain rotations and Lorentz boosts of the coordinate systems. The behaviors of elementary particles under such transformations, characterized by their spin quantum numbers, divide particles into two groups. Those with half integer spins are known as ``fermions'', which are described in \ref{sec:Fermion} in details. Particles with integer spins are known as ``bosons'', which are described in \autoref{sec:Boson} in details. 

\section{Fermion}
\label{sec:Fermion}

Named after Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, fermions follow Fermi-Dirac statistics and obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which prohibits two or more fermions with the same quantum number from simultaneously occupying the same quantum state. The matter existed in the universe is made up of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions that can be broken into two groups, quarks and leptons. They are represented by ``spinors'' under Lorentz transformations. For example, the free Lagrangian that encodes full information of a spinor field can be expressed as,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lefthand}
\mathcal{L}=i\psi_{R}^{\dagger}\sigma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi_{R}
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:righthand}
\mathcal{L}=i\psi_{L}^{\dagger}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi_{L},
\end{equation}

where $\sigma^{\mu}$ is the 2$\times$2 Pauli matrix. The spinors in Equation~\ref{eq:lefthand}-\ref{eq:righthand} are known as Weyl spinors, which correspond to two-dimensional irreducible representations of the Lorentz group. Weyl spinors can be classified into left handed spinros $\psi_{L}$ or right handed spinors $\psi_{R}$ depending on the orientation of their spin relative to their momentum. More formally, $\psi_{R}$ and $\psi_{L}$ correspond to the ($\frac{1}{2}$,0) and (0,$\frac{1}{2}$) representation of the Lorentz group~\cite{zee:group}.

In addition to Lorentz invariance, the free Lagrangians should also be invariant under parity transformation. For Weyl spinors, however, this symmetry is clearly violated as right handed spinors transform into left hand spinors under parity, and vice versa. To describe elementary fermions, the two irreducible representations must be stacked together, forming a four-dimensional reducible representation ($\frac{1}{2}$,0) $\bigoplus$ (0,$\frac{1}{2}$),

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:leftandright}
\mathcal{L}=i\psi_{R}^{\dagger}\sigma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi_{R}+i\psi_{L}^{\dagger}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi_{L}.
\end{equation}

It is also possible to introduce additional Lorentz- and parity-invariant terms $m(\psi_{R}^{\dagger}\psi_{L}+\psi_{L}^{\dagger}\psi_{R})$ to Equation~\ref{eq:leftandright},

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:DiracLag}
\mathcal{L}_{Dirac}=i\psi_{R}^{\dagger}\sigma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi_{R}+i\psi_{L}^{\dagger}\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi_{L}+m(\psi_{R}^{\dagger}\psi_{L}+\psi_{L}^{\dagger}\psi_{R}),
\end{equation}

where $m$ corresponds to the physical mass of the fermions. Equation~\ref{eq:DiracLag} is known as the Dirac Lagrangian. Using the Euler-Lagrange equation that is based on the principle of least action,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\psi}-\partial_{\mu}\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_{\mu}\psi)}=0,
\end{equation}

the equation of motion for the Dirac Lagrangian can be written as,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Dirac1}
i\sigma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi_{R}=m\psi_{L}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Dirac2}
i\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi_{L}=m\psi_{R}
\end{equation}

Defining the four-dimensional Dirac spinor as $\psi=\begin{psmallmatrix}\psi_{R}\\\psi_{L}\end{psmallmatrix}$ and the 4$\times$4 Dirac matrix as $\gamma^{\mu}=\begin{psmallmatrix}0&\bar{\sigma}^{\mu}\\\sigma^{\mu}&0\end{psmallmatrix}$, Equation~\ref{eq:Dirac1}-\ref{eq:Dirac2} can be rewritten as,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Dirac}
i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi-m\psi=0,
\end{equation}

which is the famed Dirac equation first derived by British physicist Paul Dirac~\cite{Dirac:1928hu}. Ironically, Dirac arrived at this equation with a simple goal of finding a relativistic equation with only one power of space-time derivative, and was puzzled by the negative-energy solutions to his equation. It was later understood these negative-energy solutions correspond to anti-particles that have the same mass but opposite signs of all quantum numbers. The existence of such particles was first confirmed by American physicist C. D. Anderson in 1932~\cite{PhysRev.43.491}, who used cloud chamber to produce to first photographic evidence of positron, which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Positron}.

Quarks participate in all known fundamental interactions and they exist in two different types, up-type and down-type. Up-type and down-type quarks carry $+\frac{2}{3}$ and $-\frac{1}{3}$ electric charges, respectively, in units of the electron charge. For each type of quarks, there exist three generations of quarks that are identical copies of each other, with the exception of their masses. For up-type quarks, the three generations are: i) up (u), ii) charm (c), and iii) top (t) quarks, which  The three generations of up-type quarks are illustrated in the first three columns of the first row in Figure~\ref{fig:Field}. For down-type quarks, the three generations are: i) down (d), ii) strange (s), and iii) bottom (b) quarks. The three generations of down-type quarks are illustrated in the first three columns of the second row in Figure~\ref{fig:Field}. Unlike leptons, which don't interact strongly, quarks carry three types of ``color'' charges: red, green, and blue, which allow them to participate in strong interactions. Strong interactions are discussed in more details in \autoref{chap:QCD}.

With the exception of top quarks, which decay before forming bound states, quarks are only observed in bound states called ``hadrons'' as stable particles must be color neutral, and carry integer electric charge. A quark can form two-particle bound states called ``meson'' with another anti-quark with opposite color charges. In addition to two-particle bound states, quarks can also form three- or more-particle bound states. The three-particle bound states, such as proton (uud), are known as ``baryons''. Bound states with more than three quarks are extremely unstable with short life time, such as the pentaquark recently discovered by the \ac{LHCb} experiment~\cite{LHCb:2015yax}. Because isolated quarks do not exist in nature, their existence must be inferred from the decay products of high energy collisions. Historically, lighter quarks were observed first as the production of heavier quarks require higher energy. For example, the existence of charm quarks were confirmed in 1974 at Brookhaven~\cite{E598:1974sol} and SLAC~\cite{SLAC-SP-017:1974ind} (illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:JPsi}) while top quarks were only observed in 1995 at Tevatron~\cite{CDF:1995wbb,D0:1995jca}.

Leptons are divided into charged-leptons and neutral-leptons. Charged-lepton carry $-1$ electric charge while neutral-lepton, as the name suggests, do not carry any electric charge. Charged-leptons participate in electromagnetism and weak interactions while neutral-leptons only participate in weak interactions. Similar to quarks, charged-leptons and neutral-leptons exist in three generations, also referred to as ``flavors''. For charged-leptons, the three flavors are: i) electron (e), ii) muon ($\upmu$), and iii) tau ($\uptau$). The three flavors of charged-leptons are illustrated in the first three columns of the third row in Figure~\ref{fig:Field}. Neutral-leptons are known as ``neutrinos'', which are considered massless in the \ac{SM}. The three flavors of neutrinos are: i) electron neutrino ($\upnu_{\textsf{e}}$), ii) muon neutrino ($\upnu_{\upmu}$), and iii) tau neutrino ($\upnu_{\uptau}$). The three flavors of neutral-leptons are illustrated in the first three columns of the fourth row in Figure~\ref{fig:Field}.

Leptons shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Field} have definite masses created by the interaction with Higgs bosons. They are used to described freely propagating particles of the same mass and quantum numbers, referred to as the ``mass eigenstates''. The three flavors of charged-leptons correspond exactly to their mass eigenstates, which means charged-lepton flavor is conserved in weak interactions. For neutrinos, however, their flavor eigenstates are not identical to their mass eigenstates, which allows neutrinos to oscillate between flavors as they propagate through space. The topic of fermion flavor is discussed further in \autoref{sec:Flavor}. 

Tau lepton is the only lepton that can decay into hadrons (through weak interactions), owing to its higher mass relative to other leptons. The higher mass also means more energy is needed to produce tau leptons. After a decade long hunt, tau lepton was eventually detected in 1974 at SLAC~\cite{Perl:1975bf}. Neutrinos only interact weakly, making it virtually impossible to detect them using any general-purpose detectors. In fact, it wasn't until the detection of tau neutrino in 2001 by dedicated experiment at Fermilab~\cite{DONUT:2000fbd} before all three flavors of neutrinos were experimentally confirmed. 

\section{Boson}
\label{sec:Boson}

Bosons are named after Indian physicist Satyendra Bose, who along with Einstein, developed the foundations for Bose-Einstein statistics, which states that identical integer spin particles may occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. Elementary bosons in the \ac{SM} consist of spin-1 bosons, which behaves like a vector under Lorentz transformation, and scalar bosons with a spin of 0. Vector bosons can be massive or massless and they are mediators of the fundamental forces. For example, photons are quanta of the massless vector field that mediates the electromagnetism between charged particles. From a theoretical perspective, a photon field can be introduced by adding two terms to the Dirac Lagrangian,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:QED}
\mathcal{L}=-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+i\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi-m\bar{\psi}\psi-e\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}A_{\mu}\psi,
\end{equation}

where the first term in Equation~\ref{eq:QED} is know as the Electromagnetic tensor, which characterizes the space-time properties of the photon field. The last term in Equation~\ref{eq:QED} describes the interaction between the fermion fields, mediated by the photon field. 

Three massive exist: W$^{+}$, W$^{-}$, and Z.
