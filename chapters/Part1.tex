\part{Theoretical Framework}
\label{Part1}
The \autoref{Part1} of this thesis gives a brief introduction of the theoretical framework behind the physics programs at the \ac{LHC}, including both the \ac{SM} of particle physics and extensions of the \ac{SM} that partly motivate the physics searches discussed in \autoref{Part3} and \autoref{Part4}. The \autoref{Part1} is organized as follows. \autoref{chap:Field} introduces the field content of the standard model, including all known fermions and bosons. \autoref{chap:SM} discusses the theory of \ac{EW} interaction developed initially by Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam. The theory of strong interaction and its application to hadron colliders are discussed in \autoref{chap:QCD}. \autoref{chap:BSM} discusses a few fissures exposed in the \ac{SM} in recent years along with models that aim to accommodate them. Finally, a model-independent framework called \ac{EFT} is discussed in \autoref{chap:EFT}. Materials presented in the \autoref{Part1} are borrowed liberally from various milestone papers and popular graduate physics textbooks, and thus shall not be considered original work of my own.
