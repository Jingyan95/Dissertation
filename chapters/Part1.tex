\part{Theoretical Framework}
\label{Part1}
The \autoref{Part1} of this thesis gives a brief introduction of the theoretical framework behind the physics programs at the \ac{LHC}, including both the \ac{SM} of particle physics and extensions of the \ac{SM} that partly motivate the physics searches discussed in \autoref{Part3} and \autoref{Part4}. Materials presented in this part of the thesis are borrowed liberally from various milestone papers and popular graduate physics textbooks, and thus shall not be considered original work of my own. The \autoref{Part1} is organized as follows. \autoref{sec:SM} discusses the theory of electroweak interaction developed initially by Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam. The theory of strong interaction and its application to hadron colliders are discussed in \autoref{sec:QCD}. \autoref{sec:BSM} introduces several popular \ac{UV}-complete models that aims to accommodate a few fissures exposed in the \ac{SM}. Finally, a model independent framework called \ac{EFT} is discussed in \autoref{sec:EFT}.
