\part{Experimental Apparatus}
\label{Part2}
The \autoref{Part2} of this thesis gives a brief description of the experimental apparatus that provides the physical environment and data collection for analyses described in \autoref{Part3} and \autoref{Part4}. Questions raised in \autoref{sec:Flavor} require the refinement of our knowledge of nature at its smallest scale. The \ac{LHC} is best prepared to help us achieve this goal as it is the most powerful particle physics accelerator in the world, colliding protons at a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV in 2023. The \ac{CMS} detector is one of several detectors that is capable of recording data under the harsh physical environment created by the \ac{LHC}. The \autoref{Part2} is organized as follows. \autoref{chap:LHC} discusses the \ac{LHC} and its surrounding \ac{CERN} accelerator complex. An overview of the \ac{CMS} detector is given in \autoref{chap:CMS}. Details on event reconstruction in \ac{CMS} are given in \autoref{chap:Event}. I personally contributed to the \ac{CMS} operations and Phase-2 Upgrade, which are discussed in \autoref{chap:Ops} and \autoref{chap:Upgrade}, respectively. Materials presented in \autoref{chap:LHC}-\autoref{chap:Event} are borrowed from various publications and public documents, to which I made no direct contributions. Except where noted, materials (i.e. figures and tables) presented in \autoref{chap:Upgrade} are prepared by myself.
